         <h3> What is the Disaster Resilience Rating for Hotels?</h3>
         The DRRH is a thesis (capstone) project by a group of graduate students from the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), centered on co-creating a disaster resilience rating together with hotel industry associations/groups that will be shared publicly via Online Travel Agents (OTAs) and other media platforms as a way of gaining confidence from the general public.
